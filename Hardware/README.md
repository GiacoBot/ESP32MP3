# Hardware

This folder contains the hardware design files for the project's custom development board.
Each hardware revision is organized in its own subfolder to keep designs clean, traceable, and easy to reference.

### Dev boards

* **Devboard Rev1.0** – First prototype of the dev board. Includes schematics, PCB layout, Gerber files, and BOM.
* **Devboard Rev1.1** – Updated revision addressing small issues found in Rev1.0. Recommended for new builds.

The development board is a semi-finished prototype, created to also validate the electrical design of the battery-charging circuitry and the buck-boost voltage regulation stage.
Its purpose is to verify the power system and provide a convenient and compact development board.
